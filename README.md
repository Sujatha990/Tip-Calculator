# Tip-Calculator

The tip is the money given as a gift for good service, to the person who serves you in a restaurant. In this project, 
a simple tip calculator is made which takes billing amount, type of service, and a number of persons as input. 
As per the three inputs it generates a tip for the serving person.

Using HTML we are giving desired structure, option for the input, and submit button. With the help of CSS, 
we are beautifying our structure by giving colors and desired font, etc.

In the JavaScript section, we are processing the taken input and after calculating, the respective output is printed.
